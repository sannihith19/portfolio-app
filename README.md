//first we need to install the modules required to run the code
open the project folder 
open terminal ctrl+shift+`
make sure you are in your project folder and click npm install

this will install all needed modules and creates node modules file

//run the application
npm start

this starts our app in localhost::3000


//in the application we have a side bar in which we have 3 sections
1. profile 
this part contains about me, my artwork, contact information
2.async
this is where we are calling the dummy data and displaying it in a table
we also have clear button to clear and fetch button to get the data
3.sync
